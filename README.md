# C-Projects

Writing a program called wordCounter.cpp that opens any file by accpeting input from a user and counts the whitespace-separated words in that file.

The program lineReader, opens a (text) file, and displays the contents of that file one line at a time. After a line has been displayed, the program should wait for the user to press the <enter> key before displaying the next line in the file.
